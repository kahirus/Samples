Ioner is a turn-based survival game in early MVP. The game takes on a group of survivors who try to survive in a post-apocalyptic reality dominated by mutated creatures. Their only chance is to reach the survivors' camp, led by the Enlighteners, where they can exchange Ioner's links for asylum. To achieve their goal, they must constantly fight for their lives and move safely between cities.
As a player, you will have to lead this group. Assign quests to the heroes, gain experience, develop skills, collect resources, and explore nearby buildings and locations.
Remember, not only mutants lurk among the ruins, but also people who have nothing to lose. Be ready to fight for survival in this alien world. It's up to you how many heroes will survive. Your decisions can bring rescue, but also loss.

 This code features Activities system used for handling action in a camp (assigning people to do certain things). Activities use skills level to determinate the outcome (for example how many food is collected or how fast the car is fixed). At the end of the turn all the activities are gathered and progress is made. I focused on inheritance and separating different layers.
