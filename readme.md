Ioner, Australia is a Lie.

In my free time I like working on games, so all the code shown here is part of them, tailored for Unity engine.


Code from Indygo (oldest and biggest project, released in stores) is not included, as it's almost 2 years old and was written when I was still learning C#. I don't think this old code should be put here, but on demand I can send some to show the progress I made since that time.
